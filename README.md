## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my first hand on github and by extension git as well.
I aspire to be a software engineer.
For now, my projects will mostly by coded using c++ or python... depends on what I want to make.

At the moment, I'm still practicing my skills in c++ (its one hell of a beast to master BD).

C++ is really my first programming language but if we go into technicals it was JavaScript,
but...eh. Apparently js sucks lol.

Anyways...I'll probably be working on games to practice using SDL2 as my framework 
and OpenGL in the future (sorry future me wkwkwkwk).

I guess... that's all! Wish me luck!
